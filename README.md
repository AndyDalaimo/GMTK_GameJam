# GMTK_GameJam
UE5 Game made for GMTK Game Jam 2023

Bun Hunt was made in 48 hours for the Game Maker's Toolkit Game Jam 2023

The theme for this jam was: Roles Reversed 

We set out to make an endless 2.5D side scroller where the player does not control the main character, 
but rather the sidekick clearing out obstacles out of the way and using his item to flip the main character out of harms way
via a click and drag launch mechanic similar to Angry Birds. 

The game can be downloaded and played for free at: https://andydalaimo.itch.io/bun-hunt
